# polarizability-and-static-raman-activity

`polarizability.py` is for static polarizability: to calculate the polarizability of a given configuration.

`staticraman.py` is for static raman activities. The result is slightly larger than the Gaussian result.

`test.ipynb` is a test for the two modules above.

`together.ipynb` is for debugging and it does not depend on the modules above. You can run the cells one by one to get both the polarizability and the raman activity.
